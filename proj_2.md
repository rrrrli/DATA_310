Below is the chart containing the information of the best 15 models: 


### Are you able to use the feature selection penalty to tune your hyperparameter and remove any potentially irrelevant predictors? 

### Provide justification for your selected penalty value? ###

### Finally, provide your ROC plots and interpret them. How effective is your penalized logistic regression model at predicting each of the five wealth outcomes. ###
